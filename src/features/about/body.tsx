      <p>
        i am a self-taught web developer based in north georgia. i enjoy using
        my time by coming up with new ideas or building ideas i have written
        down. coding has been an aspiration of mine since i was 14, but i never
        took it seriously until 2024.
      </p>
      <p>
        my main focus in my personal projects is full-stack, though i am most
        fluent in frontend development. many things interest me in both frontend
        and backend, so i strive every day to learn and improve my skills. ðŸ˜‡
